🏦💳 OOP Bank Account Challenge – Solution

This project is a Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) exercise that demonstrates how to design and use a simple BankAccount class in Python.
Inside the notebook, you’ll find:

🧠 Clear explanations

🧱 Class implementation

🧪 Example usage

💰 Deposit & withdrawal logic

This challenge is part of the Python Zero to Hero course by José Portilla, created to help learners (like me!) strengthen their OOP skills through practical, hands-on coding.


📊 2. Salary Analysis with Pandas

This project uses Python and the pandas library to analyze salary information from a given table. The dataset includes details such as salary, tax, benefits, and more.

With this code, you can easily calculate:

💵 Net income (how much money someone actually takes home)

🧾 Tax rate

📈 Average salary

📉 Other useful financial insights

This challenge was part of the Python Zero to Hero course by José Portilla, assigned to help learners (like me!) practice real-world data analysis using pandas.

3. Tic-Tac-Toe Game Using Python

This project is another challenge from the course, where I built a fully playable Tic-Tac-Toe game using only Python tools.,

In this file, you’ll see:

🧠 The core game logic

🔁 Functions handling player turns

🏆 Win-condition checks

🎲 Board updates and user input

♻️ Replay functionality

It’s a great demonstration of applying fundamental Python skills—functions, loops, conditionals, and logic—to create a complete interactive game.
